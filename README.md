# Kidney Stone Detection 🩺

## **Project Overview**
This project is a deep learning-based system designed to detect kidney stones and other abnormalities from medical images (CT scans). By leveraging the power of **ResNet18** architecture, the model classifies images into four categories: **Cyst**, **Normal**, **Stone**, and **Tumor**. This system is developed to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing kidney-related conditions with high accuracy and speed.

## **Key Features**
- **Deep Learning-Powered**: Utilizes **ResNet18**, a cutting-edge convolutional neural network architecture.
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Classifies medical images into four distinct categories: **Cyst**, **Normal**, **Stone**, and **Tumor**.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Includes drag-and-drop functionality with an additional "Choose File" option for uploading images.
- **Performance Metrics**: Provides a confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve for thorough performance evaluation.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Offers immediate predictions with confidence scores for uploaded images.
